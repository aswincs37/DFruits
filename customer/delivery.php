    There may be a possibility of multiple shipments for a single placed order in case any issue was to arise on delivery while trying to meet the timing demands of the customer as well as to fulfil the customerâ€™s complete order. These may happen in the cases of: Late stock arrival after original order dispatch, Return and exchange of items and re-sending new items, missing items from the original dispatched order being re-sent, or for carrying goods requiring different storage conditions within different vans.
    Orders that are altered/changed after checkout and payment on the website, for reasons including; No stock availability on date of dispatch, Return of goods, exchange of goods, leading for multiple shipments may result in multiple postings to the cardholders monthly statement.</p><br>
